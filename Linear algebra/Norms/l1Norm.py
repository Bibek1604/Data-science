import numpy as np

x=np.array([25,2,5])
y=np.abs(25) + np.abs(2) + np.abs(5)
print(y)
# l1 norm
# answer is 32 because it is the sum of the absolute values of the elements in the array

#what are absolute values?
# Absolute values are the non-negative value of a number without regard to its sign.
# For example, the absolute value of -5 is 5, and the absolute value of 5 is also 5.
# In mathematical notation, the absolute value of a number x is denoted as |x|.



## it emans in l1 norms we get value 32 beacse all are positive value and they are added together
# In this case, the absolute values of the elements in the array are 25, 2, and 5.
