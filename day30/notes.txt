refresher on machinelearning

why to use refresher?
- to understand the basics of machine learning
- to understand the concepts of machine learning


In the context of **Machine Learning (ML) models**, a **"Refresher"** generally refers to:

### **1. Model Refreshing:**

* **Updating an existing ML model with new data.**
* This ensures that the model stays **relevant and accurate** over time, especially in environments where data changes frequently (like fraud detection).

### **2. Incremental Learning:**

* Instead of retraining the model from scratch, you incrementally update the model with new data.
* This is useful for large datasets where full retraining is computationally expensive.

3. Online Learning:**

* The model continuously learns from new data as it arrives, making it adaptive to changing patterns.
* This is common in fraud detection, where new fraud techniques appear regularly.

### **4. Periodic Model Retraining:**

* Setting a schedule (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly) to retrain the model with fresh data.
* Useful for keeping the model aligned with the latest data patterns.

### **Why Model Refreshing is Important in Fraud Detection:**

* Fraudsters constantly change their tactics, making it crucial for the model to learn from new fraudulent behaviors.
* Without refreshing, the model can become outdated and lose its effectiveness.

## **1. Regression Models in Fraud Detection**

### **1.1 Logistic Regression:**

* **Type:** Supervised Classification Model.
* **Usage:** Best suited for binary classification (fraud or non-fraud).
* **Mathematical Concept:**

  * Uses the logistic function:

    $$
    P(y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \ldots + \beta_nx_n)}}
    $$
  * The output is a probability between 0 and 1.
* **Advantages:**

  * Simple and fast.
  * Interpretable (feature coefficients can be explained).
* **Disadvantages:**

  * Limited to linear relationships.
  * Can struggle with complex, non-linear data.
* **Application in Fraud Detection:**

  * Predicts the probability of a transaction being fraudulent.
  * Can use features like transaction amount, customer age, location.

### **1.2 Regularization in Logistic Regression:**

* **L1 Regularization (Lasso):** Penalizes the absolute value of coefficients (feature selection).
* **L2 Regularization (Ridge):** Penalizes the square of coefficients (prevents overfitting).

## **2. Decision Trees in Fraud Detection**

### **2.1 What are Decision Trees?**

* **Type:** Supervised Classification or Regression Model.
* **Structure:** Tree-like model with branches representing decisions and outcomes.
* **Working:**

  * Splits data at each node based on feature values (e.g., transaction amount > \$500).
  * Each leaf node represents a class label (Fraud/Not Fraud).

### **2.2 Key Concepts:**

* **Gini Impurity:** Measures the impurity of a split:

  $$
  Gini = 1 - \sum p_i^2
  $$
* **Entropy:** Measures information gain:

  $$
  Entropy = -\sum p_i \log_2 p_i
  $$
* **Recursive Partitioning:** Continuously splits data until a stopping criterion is met (max depth, min samples).

### **2.3 Advantages:**

* Easy to interpret (visualizable).
* Can handle non-linear data.

### **2.4 Disadvantages:**

* Prone to overfitting (especially deep trees).
* Sensitive to noisy data.

## **3. Random Forests in Fraud Detection**

### **3.1 What is Random Forest?**

* **Type:** Ensemble Learning Model (Multiple Decision Trees).
* **Concept:** Averages the predictions of multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting.
* **How It Works:**

  * Creates multiple decision trees using different random samples of data (Bootstrap).
  * Each tree is trained on a random subset of features.
  * Final prediction is the average (regression) or majority vote (classification) of all trees.

### **3.2 Key Concepts:**

* **Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging):** Randomly samples data for each tree.
* **Feature Randomization:** Randomly selects features for each tree split.
* **Out-of-Bag Error (OOB):** Estimates model accuracy using unused data.

### **3.3 Advantages:**

* Highly accurate and robust.
* Less prone to overfitting compared to single decision trees.

### **3.4 Disadvantages:**

* Computationally expensive (many trees).
* Less interpretable than a single decision tree.

## **4. Neural Networks in Fraud Detection**

### **4.1 What is a Neural Network?**

* **Type:** Deep Learning Model (Supervised).
* **Structure:** Consists of:

  * **Input Layer:** Receives data features (transaction amount, customer ID).
  * **Hidden Layers:** Perform calculations using activation functions.
  * **Output Layer:** Produces final prediction (fraud or not fraud).

### **4.2 Types of Neural Networks:**

* **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP):** Fully connected network, suitable for tabular data.
* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):** For sequential data (time series).
* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** For image-based fraud detection (image recognition).

### **4.3 Activation Functions:**

* **Sigmoid:** For binary classification.

  $$
  f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
  $$
* **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** For hidden layers.

  $$
  f(x) = \max(0, x)
  $$

### **4.4 How Neural Networks Work:**

* Each neuron performs a weighted sum of inputs.
* Applies an activation function to produce an output.
* Uses **Backpropagation** to adjust weights:

  * Calculates error at output.
  * Adjusts weights using gradient descent.

### **4.5 Advantages:**

* Can capture complex, non-linear relationships.
* Suitable for large, complex datasets.

### **4.6 Disadvantages:**

* Requires large amounts of data.
* Computationally expensive (GPU recommended).
